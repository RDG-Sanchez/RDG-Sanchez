<h1>¡Hi, I'm Rafael! 👋</h1>

<p>😊 I'm a passionate web developer with experience in the world of Full Stack. My innate curiosity about technology led me to explore programming from an early age. At age 15, I started modifying web templates to create my own sites. However, my ambition did not stop there; I wanted to not only modify, but also create.

📜 A long time passed, at 23 years old, my search for knowledge led me to Soy Henry, where I was able to deepen my skills and values. Since then, I have been working on Full-stack Developer projects, where I have applied my knowledge in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, ExpressJS, NodeJS, Sequelize and others.

🚀 My main goal is to continue growing as a professional and contribute my skills to the world of web development. I am always willing to learn and face new challenges.

🤝 Let's connect on LinkedIn and explore new opportunities together!</p>
